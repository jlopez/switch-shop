# Active Context

## What We're Working On Now

We have completed the implementation of the Switch Shop project. We've built a Next.js application using Bun as the runtime that serves files from a library directory.

1. Created a file listing page at `/shop` that displays all files in the library
2. Implemented file downloads at `/shop/[name]` endpoint
3. Added proper error handling and content type detection

## Recent Changes

1. Implemented the file system utilities to scan the library directory
2. Created React components for the file listing with proper styling
3. Added file download functionality with appropriate content types
4. Fixed issues with Next.js 15's handling of dynamic route parameters
5. Created a comprehensive README.md file
6. Configured environment variables for library path and server port

## Next Steps

1. Potential improvements:
   - Add sorting and filtering options for the file list
   - Implement search functionality
   - Add pagination for large libraries
   - Enhance the UI with thumbnails for media files
   - Add authentication for protected files

2. Deployment:
   - Deploy the application to a production environment
   - Set up proper environment variables in production
   - Configure caching for better performance

3. Maintenance:
   - Monitor for any issues with large files or special characters in filenames
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Add automated tests
